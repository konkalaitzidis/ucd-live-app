University College Dublin - Practical Android Programming Module

Semester-long Project description:
Campus life at the University College of Dublin is evolving every year. The number of student societies that are newly developed on a year by year basis is only increasing. Students of all kind can expect to find extracurriculars to get evolved with but often find themselves missing out on the events that they would really enjoy and benefit from not to mention events that match their interests and help them achieve higher academic or even career success. The UCDLive application developed by Chris Horgan, Lorenzo Gazella, and Kostas Kalaitzidis on the grounds of the Practical Android Programming module at the Computer Science department of UCD aims to provide a solution to this issue that faces most students on campus.
