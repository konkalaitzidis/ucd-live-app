**University College Dublin – Practical Android Programming Module**  
**Sep 2018 – Dec 2018**  

## Project Overview

UCDLive is a mobile application designed to help students at University College Dublin (UCD) discover and engage with extracurricular events and student societies on campus. With the increasing number of student societies each year, students often miss out on events that match their interests and can help further their academic or career success. UCDLive aims to solve this problem by providing a platform that allows students to find relevant events tailored to their interests and needs.

This project was developed as part of the Practical Android Programming module in the Computer Science department at UCD.
